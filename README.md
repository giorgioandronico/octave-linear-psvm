# octave-linear-psvm
Implemented the Proximal **Support Vector Machine** (PSVM) algorithm from scratch in **Octave** as a **nonlinear optimization problem**. Conducted binary classification using a bilevel **cross-validation** approach with 10-fold and 5-fold validation. Visualized the results, achieving good metrics.
